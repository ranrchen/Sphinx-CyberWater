 <i><h2>MainGenerator</h2></i> The first component of the Generic Model Agent tools. <br> 
 This component is responsible for setting up the folder where the simulation will be performed. <br>
 It receives all the forcing datasets as inputs. The order at which they are added matters, <br> 
 since the final forcing files will display the data in the same order: <br> 
 first Dataset_01, then Dataset_02, and so on. <br>
 The purpose of the Generic Model Agent tools is to enable the integration of new Models into the <br>
 CyberWater environment. Therefore, users are expected to be highly knowledgeable about the <br>
 details of their own models if they want to perform an integration with the Generic tools. <br>
